<h2>Early Writings</h2> 
<p>Octavia Butler first started writing stories at 10. During college, she attended the <a href="http://clarion.ucsd.edu/about-clarion/" target=_blank">Clarion workshop</a> for young science fiction writers. Her first published work, a short story called <i>Crossover</i>, was included in 1971 Clarion Anthology. After graduating, Butler began publishing the <a href="https://www.tor.com/2009/02/02/whos-human-anyway-whos-free-octavia-butlers-qpatternq-series/" target="_blank">Patternist series</a>. The series focuses on telepathic mind control between different groups and the struggle for power.</p> 
<p>Before finishing the Patternist series, Butler published <i>Kindred</i> (1979), her most famous work. Dana, the main character, is a Black American woman who repeatedly travels back in time to the 1800s and has to save her white, slave-owning ancestor. In the series, Dana learns more about her family history. She struggles between helping slaves on the plantation and saving her ancestor (inherently saving herself).</p> 
  <h2>Xenogenesis series</h2> 
  <p>During the 80s, Butler published her next series, the Xenogenesis trilogy. The series starts off after humanity is saved from nuclear war by the Oankali, an alien race. The humans who survive are left with an existential dilemma: the Oankali have made every human infertile unless they breed with the Oankali. Humans have the choice to practice gene trading with the Oankali and produce hybrid Oankali human offspring or live isolated and die off. The main characters in the second and third novels are Oankali human hybrids who attempt to reconcile their humanity while deciding whether to help isolated humans. Butler tackles issues such as disability, colonialism, consent, and race throughout the series as well.</p> 
<p><i>Dawn</i> (1987), the first book in the trilogy, is being adapted as a <a href= "http://octaviabutler.org/2017/08/dawn-being-adadpted-for-television-by-charles-d-kings-macro-and-director-writer-victoria-mahoney/" target="_blank">TV series</a>. This will be the first time Butler’s work is featured as a TV show.</p> 
<h2>Earthseed series</h2> 
<p>In the 90s, Butler published the Earthseed series. This series follows protagonist Lauren Olamina as she tries to survive in a lawless twenty first century. While not in a post-apocalyptic world as seen in the Xenogenesis series, the world Lauren lives in is filled with natural disasters, corporate greed, and little likelihood for survival. At 16, a fire destroys her community and Lauren is forced to travel north, where she starts the Earthseed community. Earthseed is rooted in a spiritual framework Lauren herself discovered, based on the idea "God is change."
	<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/59258-parable-of-the-sower"> 
<p>“Create no images of God. Accept the images that God has provided. They are everywhere, in everything. God is Change— Seed to tree, tree to forest; Rain to river, river to sea; Grubs to bees, bees to swarm. From one, many; from many, one; Forever uniting, growing, dissolving— forever Changing. The universe is God’s self-portrait.”</p> 
</blockquote> </p>

<p>Butler intended on producing five novels in the Earthseed series but experienced writers block writing the last three. In recent years, Butler has been in the news regarding a slogan used in <i>Parable of the Talents</i> (1998). <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/when-science-fiction-becomes-real-octavia-e-butlers-legacy/" target="_blank">"Make America Great Again,"</a> a slogan used by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was first used by authoritarian figure Andrew Steele Jarret in Butler's novel. Writers have made comparisons between Butler's descriptions of Jarret and President Trump. 
<h2><i>Fledgling</i> (2005) and Short Stories</h2> 
<p>Butler’s last novel, <i>Fledgling</i>, is a vampire novel that explores gender and racial dynamics within a vampire community.</p> 
<p>In 1995, Butler published <i>Bloodchild and Other Stories</i>, a collection of short science fiction stories. Two additional stories were added in the 2005 addition. Bloodchild has been critically acclaimed, winning both the Hugo and Nebula Awards.</p>
